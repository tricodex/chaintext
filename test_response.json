  "query": "What is the current status of the Flare network?",
  "answer": "The Flare network is currently operating normally with average block times of 1.0 seconds. Gas prices are stable at around 25 gwei, and network utilization is at 35% of capacity. Additionally, a planned network upgrade to improve FTSO data distribution is scheduled for next month, which aims to reduce response latency and improve the accuracy of price feeds.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "The answer is primarily based on the 'blockchain_state' context which has a high trust score. The information about the upcoming network upgrade is included from the 'twitter_official' context, which has a medium trust score. The information from the low trust source was not included, as it primarily describes Flare rather than providing its current status.",
