  "query": "What is the current status of the Flare network?",
  "answer": "The Flare network is currently operating normally with average block times of 1.0 seconds. Gas prices are stable at around 25 gwei, and network utilization is at 35% of capacity. Additionally, a planned network upgrade to improve FTSO data distribution is scheduled for next month, which aims to reduce response latency and improve the accuracy of price feeds.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "The answer combines information from the 'blockchain_state' source (trust score 0.63) and the 'twitter_official' source (trust score 0.42). The 'blockchain_state' source provides the current operational status, while the 'twitter_official' source adds information about a planned upgrade. The overall confidence is relatively high because the core information about the network's current state comes from a highly trusted source.",
